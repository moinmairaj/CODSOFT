# CODSOFT Data Science Internship Tasks

Welcome to my CODSOFT Data Science internship repository! Here, you'll find the culmination of my efforts during my internship, showcasing various data handling techniques and the utilization of powerful Python libraries like pandas, Logistic Regression, and Linear Regression for data manipulation and model development.

## Repository Structure

I have meticulously organized the repository into distinct folders, each representing a specific task I completed during the internship at CODSOFT. Every folder contains a comprehensive README file detailing the model's intricacies, the datasets used for modeling, and the corresponding Python code or program for easy comprehension and utilization. You can readily leverage these models by downloading the provided datasets and making any necessary adjustments, such as modifying the dataset path in the program.

## Model Performance

Notably, the majority of the models developed within this repository boast impressive accuracy rates, with most exceeding 90% and some achieving a perfect 100%, tailored to the unique characteristics of the respective datasets.

### Tasks Completed:

1. **TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION:**
   Delved into the iconic Titanic dataset to construct a predictive model determining passenger survival likelihood during the tragic event.

2. **IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION:**
   Leveraged the versatile Iris dataset to create a robust model capable of accurately classifying iris flowers into distinct species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

3. **SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON:**
   Engaged in sales forecasting by harnessing two critical datasets: one for car sales prediction and another for advertising and sales prediction.

4. **CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION:**
   Developed an intricate machine learning model proficient in identifying and flagging fraudulent credit card transactions, bolstering financial security measures for users.
