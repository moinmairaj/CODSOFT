# Task 5: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

## Dataset
The dataset for CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION is not included within this folder due to its large size. Please download the dataset from the following link: [CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). The dataset comprises information regarding credit card transactions, focusing on the identification of fraudulent transactions.

## Code Overview
The 'credit_card_fraud_detection.py' script provided in this folder constitutes the foundation for the CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION model. The script implements critical stages such as data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and the utilization of the Logistic Regression algorithm to identify potential instances of fraudulent credit card transactions based on the dataset's attributes.

## Code Implementation
The Python script commences by importing necessary libraries and reading the credit card dataset using 'pd.read_csv'. The script performs comprehensive data analysis, including checks for null values and duplicates, ensuring the dataset's integrity. It further prepares the dataset for model training, employing feature scaling for optimal model performance.

# Code Explanation

The 'credit_card_fraud_detection.py' script embodies crucial functionalities and stages:

## Data Collection and Initial Analysis
The script initiates by importing essential libraries and reading the credit card dataset, conducting an initial analysis using functions such as 'info' and 'head', ensuring data consistency and quality.

## Data Preprocessing and Model Training
The script processes the data, separating it into features and target variables, X and Y, respectively. Feature scaling is implemented using the 'StandardScaler' function, preparing the dataset for model training. The data is split into training and testing sets using the 'train_test_split' function, ensuring comprehensive model evaluation.

## Logistic Regression Model and Evaluation
The script leverages the Logistic Regression algorithm to train the model, generating predictions for both the training and testing datasets. The model's performance is evaluated using the 'accuracy_score' function, illustrating the model's robustness in accurately identifying fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Results Analysis
The Logistic Regression model demonstrates a remarkable accuracy score of nearly 99%, indicating its high precision in identifying instances of fraudulent credit card transactions. The model's exceptional performance underscores its reliability and effectiveness in safeguarding against potential fraudulent activities, offering valuable insights for enhancing credit card transaction security.
